# Objectives
The main goal of this course is to build a comprehensive understanding of GIS and enhance my proficiency in Python for spatial data analysis. I want to focus on learning how to effectively source, manipulate, and represent spatial data to address pressing urban transportation issues. By the conclusion of the course, I aim to confidently leverage GIS tools and Python programming to develop innovative solutions for challenges in transportation engineering and urban mobility planning.
# Project Ideas
For this course, I plan to focus on analyzing urban transportation issues using spatial data. One idea is to evaluate public transit accessibility in Los Angeles, identifying underserved areas and proposing solutions for better transit coverage. Another idea is to map and analyze traffic congestion hotspots to understand patterns and suggest strategies for improving traffic flow. Both projects will leverage GIS tools and Python programming to process and visualize data, providing practical insights into transportation challenges.
